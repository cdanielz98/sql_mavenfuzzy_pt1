<h2><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>The Situation</h2>
You've just been hired as an eCommerce Database Analyst for Maven Fuzzy Factory, an online retailer which has just launched their first product.
<h2><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>The Brief</h2>
As a member of the startup team, you will work with the CEO, the Marketing Director, and the Website Manager to help steer the business.
You will analyse and optimise marketing channels, measure and test website conversion performance, and use data to understand the impact if new product launches.

<h2><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>Part 1</h2>

<h3><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>1. Gsearch seems to the the biggest driver of our business. Could you pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions and orders so that we can showcase the growth there?

>Both sessions and orders have been increasing monthly.
<br>
<br>
2. Next, it would be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.

>Nonbrand campaigns are bringing in significantly more sessions and orders than brand campaigns.
<br>
<br>

3. While we're on Gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand and pull monthly sessions and device type? I want to show the board we really know our traffic sources.

>There were far more desktop sessions than mobile sessions, and number of sessions from both device types increased monthly.
<br>
<br>

4. I'm worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % traffic from Gsearch. Can you pull monthly trends for Gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each other channel?

<br>
<br>

5. I'd like to tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. Could you pull session to order conversion rates, by month?

>There is a steady increase in session to order conversion rates since it began 8 months ago.
<br>
<br>
6. For Gsearch lander test, please estimate the revenue that test earned us. lander test: (Jun 19-Jul 28).

![6](https://github.com/cdanielz98/maven-fuzzy-factory-sql/assets/135237144/fd4efe9f-8708-4436-a0cb-3d80a5dd688e)

>* '/home' conversion rate = 0.0318<br>
>* '/lander-1' conversion rate = 0.0406<br>
>* a difference in conversion rate of 0.0088 (an additional 0.0088 orders per session with new lander page)

![6 2](https://github.com/cdanielz98/maven-fuzzy-factory-sql/assets/135237144/fa792353-936a-41d1-b77d-ff6b976ce79f)


>* 22972 sessions since the test ended<br>
>* 22972 * 00.0088 = roughly 202 extra orders since the test ended on 2012-07-28<br>
>* which is almost a difference of 4 months so:<br>
>* 202/4 = about 50 extra orders a month since before test
<br>
<br>
7. For the landing page test you analyzed previously, it would be great to show a full conversion frunnel from each of the two pages to orders. You can use the same time period you analyzed last time (Jun 19 - Jul 28).

>* 'thankyou_clickthrough_rate' corresponds to the rate of users that clicked on to the 'thank-you-for-your-order-page' from the previous page (billing page).<br>
>* thankyou_clickthrough rate for:<br>
>* /home = 0.4286<br>
>* /lander-1 = 0.4772<br>
>* There were 5% more completed orders in the 'lander-1' condition compared to the '/home' condition.
<br>
<br>

8. Quantify the impact of our billing test. Analyze the lift generated from the test (Sep 10 - Nov 10), in terms of revenue per billing page session, and then pull the number of billing page sessions for the past month to understand monthly impact.

>* '/billing-2' refers to the new billing page being tested, and '/billing' refers to the original billing page<br>
>* revenue_per_session for billing = 22.826 USD<br>
>* revenue_per_session for billing-2 = 31.311 USD<br>
>* *LIFT= 8.486 USD per billing page view*

* >1193 sessions in last month<br>
* >LIFT= 8.486 USD per billing page view<br>
* >*IMPACT OF BILLING TEST IN LAST MONTH: $10123.80*
